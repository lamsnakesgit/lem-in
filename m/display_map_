 You must to display your results on the standard output in the following format:
number_of_ants
the_rooms
the_links
Lx-y Lz-w Lr-o ...
x, z, r represents the ants’ numbers (going from 1 to number_of_ants) and y,
w, o represents the rooms’ names.

• In example 2.1, it is not required to use all paths, (you are free to do so as long as
the result does not have more lines, in some cases, however, it would be unwise to
do so) However, you MUST use several paths if this is necessary (see example 2.2).
• Example 2.2 :

• Finally, we ask that your algorithm be able to use the best combination of paths
according to the number of ants in cases such as the one presented below.

[4]--[2] [6]

This is not as simple as it seems
• Of course, your algorithm must render within a reasonable time, even in a case with
4000 rooms. 2 or 3 seconds is great, 9 seconds is mediocre, 15 seconds is too much.
These are maps with sometimes more than 10,000 lines, the way you
read and write data must also be fairly fast.
• Now, it would have been interesting to find out more about the type of operations
those students of the School of Wizardry could conduct with such a computer. All
that we know is that electricity is way more reliable today.
